# Task 2: Log Analyzer

## Objective
Analyze application logs to identify and summarize log severity levels.

---

## Description
This task parses log files to count occurrences of different log levels such as `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`.  
It helps identify system behavior patterns and error frequency.

This approach mirrors real-world log analysis used in production systems.

## Files
- `log_analyzer.py` – Log parsing script
- `sample.log` – Sample log input
- `summary.txt` – Generated summary output

---

## How It Works
1. Reads a log file line by line
2. Detects severity keywords
3. Maintains counters for each severity level
4. Outputs a summarized report

## How to Run
```bash
python log_analyzer.py
```

## Skills Demonstrated

- File handling

- String parsing

- Log analysis

- Automation reporting
